# Utilities for MetaSounds
 As of 13/06/2024, includes only MetaSound nodes for equal power cross fading.<br />
 Create a folder called 'Plugins' in the same folder where your UPROJECT file is found if a plugins folder does not already exist. <br />
 Copy and paste the 'MS_Utils' folder into that plugins folder. You may need to enable the plugin via Edit>Plugins from within your project.<br />
